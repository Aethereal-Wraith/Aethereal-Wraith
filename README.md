- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aethereal-Wraith, a programming hobbyist from Sydney, Australia.
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding how things work. I like learning about languages, programming, maths, science, philosophy and more. I enjoy being able to re-construct things from scratch using my understanding rather than memorising by rote.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python🐍 (very slowly as I'm a full-time Medical Science student)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can! ("I can" being limited to only the most baby of Python projects for now.)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His/Himself
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've never fallen because of untied shoelaces, but I have fractured my wrist tripping over tied-up shoelaces.
